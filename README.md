*Created for the Flutter-Community by Max Steffen & Max Berktold*

**"With this course, we want to empower developers worldwide and unite them in a great community!"**

Get started with app development with Flutter with this course. This course goes far beyond the basics and differs from other courses in that you learn really professional app development based on years of Flutter Freelancer experience.

We'll show you what really matters in a project. - Not only how to build a cool UI...We learn how to build a software architecture that is maintainable, scalable and efficient. Here you will learn the things that will accompany you throughout your career and really help you.

Don't worry - there's something for everyone here. Whether you're an experienced developer or a complete novice - We'll pick you up at every level of abstraction and guide you by the hand from the first small Flutter App to professional software architecture, functional programming, testing and much more.

In this still young framework, there are few people who are really good. So there are many possibilities here! And with the ever-increasing number of apps implemented with the Flutter Framework, so does the demand for capable developers.

Also: Flutter and the Dart language are great, really fun to develop with!

Flutter Community We now have the largest active German Flutter Community on our own Discord server. Now we create also a Server for the Englisch Community. Here you can exchange ideas with other developers and support each other. We look forward to having you with us too!
