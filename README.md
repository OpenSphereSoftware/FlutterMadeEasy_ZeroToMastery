⭐️ Dart Basics

Begin with the fundamentals of Dart programming, covering essential concepts and setting up your development environment with VS Code. Progress from understanding variables to mastering object orientation and asynchronous programming.

⭐️ Flutter Basics 

Explore the key elements of UI creation with Flutter, learning everything needed to craft your own app interfaces. Delve into framework functionality, individual UI components, themes, animations, navigation, and more!

⭐️ Clean Architecture 

Develop a simple app to learn the principles of clean software architecture for proper app development.Implement a bulletproof clean code software architecture with clear layer separation, applicable to any client app. Master this approach to achieve extremely high-quality software standards. Integrate the BLoC pattern for clean business logic and UI separation, resulting in a testable project. Utilize dependency injection and functional programming, while covering unit testing, widget testing, and integration testing to thoroughly evaluate your app.

⭐️ ToDo App - Adaptive Layout

Based on this App we will go over different topics, so we create a app that supports the new Material3 adaptive Layout. We go into the basic Form functions and as a bonus we move the validation logic into a Cubit. In this app we will use different local data sources to store all data, to have a permanent storage we will use the Hive package. The complete navigation is using the Navigator 2.0 with the go_router package.

Whats next?

As we want to improve this course over the time, you will find here the next topics that we are working on.

* Null Safety

* Update Video to flutter 3.7.x

❗️ Important: In this course, we aim to give you all the knowledge you need to start app development with Flutter quickly and effectively. We are not too "obsessed with details" and will not go into all the complex background processes that you are taught in an university course, for example. Rather we will dive into praxis as soon as possible.

Our focus is on practicality, quality and - last but not least- fun.

We are looking forward to seeing you in the course!
