# FlutterMadeEasy_ZeroToMastery
Basic Course in Dart &amp; Flutter. Introduction to modern app development with the Flutter Framework.

*Created for the Flutter-Community by Max Steffen & Max Berktold*

**"With this course, we want to empower developers worldwide and unite them in a great community!"**

Get started with app development with Flutter with this course. This course goes far beyond the basics and differs from other courses in that you learn really professional app development based on years of Flutter Freelancer experience.

We'll show you what really matters in a project. - Not only how to build a cool UI...We learn how to build a software architecture that is maintainable, scalable and efficient. Here you will learn the things that will accompany you throughout your career and really help you.

Don't worry - there's something for everyone here. Whether you're an experienced developer or a complete novice - We'll pick you up at every level of abstraction and guide you by the hand from the first small Flutter App to professional software architecture, functional programming, testing and much more.

In this still young framework, there are few people who are excellent. So there are many possibilities here! And with the ever-increasing number of apps implemented with the Flutter Framework, so does the demand for capable developers.

Also: Flutter and the Dart language are great, really fun to develop with!

Flutter Community We now have the largest active German Flutter Community on our own Discord server. Now we create also a Server for the Englisch Community. Here you can exchange ideas with other developers and support each other. We look forward to having you with us too!

### What will we learn?

#### ⭐️  Dart Basics

In this course you will first get to know the basics of programming in Dart. We will also go into the essential parts of programming with the Dart language and we will learn how to set up our development environment and deal with the Code Editor VS Code. We'll start with the basic knowledge of what a variable actually is, and then work our way up to object orientation and asynchronous programming.

#### ⭐️  Flutter Basics

Here We'll give you an introduction to the most important elements of UI creation with the Flutter Framework and teach you all the basics you need to write your own user interfaces for your apps. From the explanation of how the framework works, to the Using individual UI components, themes, animations, navigation and much more, everything is included!

#### ⭐️  Flutter Architecture

Develop a simple app to learn the principles of clean software architecture for proper app development.Implement a bulletproof clean code software architecture with clear layer separation, applicable to any client app. Master this approach to achieve extremely high-quality software standards. Integrate the BLoC pattern for clean business logic and UI separation, resulting in a testable project. Utilize dependency injection and functional programming, while covering unit testing, widget testing, and integration testing to thoroughly evaluate your app.

#### ⭐️  ToDo App - Adaptive Layout

Based on this App we will go over different topics, so we create a app that supports the new Material3 adaptive Layout. We go into the basic Form functions and as a bonus we move the validation logic into a Cubit. In this app we will use different local data sources to store all data, to have a permanent storage we will use the Hive package. The complete navigation is using the Navigator 2.0 with the go_router package.

❗️ **Important:** In this course, We aimed to give you all the knowledge you need to start app development with Flutter quickly and effectively. We am not too "obsessed with details" and will not go into all the complex background processes that you are taught in a course of study, for example.

**Here the focus is on quality and fun.**

We will show you the most important things that you need to know to get started with app development with Flutter. We will also show you how to build a professional software architecture and how to write clean code. We will also show you how to write tests and how to use the most important tools in the Flutter ecosystem.
